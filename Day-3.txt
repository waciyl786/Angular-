Typescript : 
-  It provides static data typing to JavaScript 
 - Js provides dynamic typing It means in JS, the datatype decided by the value the variables contains 

      let  a=10;  //number 
            a ="raj"  // String 
           a = true  // boolean 

 In 2012, Microsoft Launched Typescript to solve problem of JS dynamic typing 
Typescript is a superset of Javascript 
Browser cannot understand TS so tsc(typescript compiler) converts TS into JS 

To practice Typescript, Visit official website:
 https://www.typescriptlang.org/

Data Types Declaration:
  There are two ways to declare datatypes in Typescript:
1. Type Inference:
    It means datatype automatically understands by TS based on the value on first time 

2. Type annotation: 
     Using this we can provide datatypes to any variables after colon.
           Example: Let a: datatype = value;
