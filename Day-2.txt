JavaScript Basics: 

1. What is the difference between Let,Var and Const?
     Var is a function scoped and let and const are block.
     Var can be accessed before declaration and var can be reclared, let and const can't be accessed before and redeclared .
      Let can change but const cannot 
       
      function fun(){        
              if(true) 
          {
              console.log(a) 
             var a= 10 ; let b =10; const c =10
             var a=10; b=20;
           }
              console.log(a) 
            } 
             func()     

2.. What are the primitive data types of JavaScript and JS is statically typed or dynamically typed 
     number, string ,boolean ,undefined, null. js is dynamically typed
        25.36    'raj',"raj", raj, true, undefined,null 


4. Write a function which accepts two parameters and returns their sum 
       function add(a,b) 
      {
          return a+b 
          }
           add(3,4) 
---------------------------
  const add =(a,b) => a+b;
            add(3,4) 

5. What is a class and what is an object in JavaScript?
          class Bike{
            name; speed;color;milage,model;
             work()
             }
              Let x = new Bike() 

6.What is one function that default called in class?
       constructor 
       class student 
       {
         name;rno;marks;
         constructor(a,b,c){
           this.name=a;
               this.rno=b;
          this.marks=c; 
        }
          }
        let x = new Student ("raj",25,98) 
          console.log(${X.name} got $(x.marks} )
